SCRATCH
- special cases
	- user can edit own phone number, etc
	  - authorize lets them in by a special exception defined in permission
	  - form only shows certain fields, calls User.authorized?(user, action, object, field, value) for each field
	  - validate checks that only permitted fields are changed
	- user can edit users less than their own level
	  - authorize lets them in by a special exception (only permission in the table is that admins can edit unconditionally)
	  - once they're in they can do anything except change rank of a user to higher than their own rank
	  - this is enforced in validate
	- observer can delete own responses if they haven't been viewed
	  - Response.authorized?(user, 'delete', object, nil, nil) is called when delete links are being drawn
	  - also in before_destroy
	  - if not authorized, 
- so we have a permissions table that knows about controllers and actions
- for object level we also have a 'permitted?' method in applicable models that takes user, action, object arguments
