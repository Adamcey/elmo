DON'T FORGET


THINGS WE HAVE THAT NEPAL DOESN'T
- mobile submission
- multi-language
- automatic DOC generation and parsing
- robust geo engine
- roles & permissions
- questions shared across forms
- integration with high quality analytics platform
- inline tagging

THINGS NAPAL HAS THAT WE DON'T
- hierarchical form design (is this necessary?)
- richer text reporting
- customizable meta-data
- rich text in responses (is this necessary? tables may be nice to have...)

SCRATCH
- how should versions work?
  - forms can only be d/l'd with mobile devices once they're 'published'
  - # of downloads is tracked
  - can't edit a form if it's published -- have to unpublish first
  - unpublishing a downloaded form shows a big warning, since making changes could mess things up
  - but then what if you want to add a new question to a form? remove a question? change some wording? etc.
  - if you're convinced it won't affect the data, there should be an override
  - otherwise, you might want to make a new version
  - option 1: no versions, just provide a copy mechanism, let the user handle the naming conventions
    - downside here is you can't ask for all questions from all versions of a form, for instance
    - but perhaps the questions are the most important things..
  - option 2: each form has version, etc. could implement this later if it turns out to be impt...
- on response submission, we should
  - get the form ID from the submission
  - create a new response object with the given form ID
  - for each question in the submission that is also in the form definition, create an answer
    - but make sure that the given option_ids (if applicable) are actually valid for the given question
  - return
