# a subset of QuestionSummaries tied to a particular disaggregation value
# e.g., if the report is disaggregated by the answer to the 'urban/rural' question,
# there would be two SummarySubsets:
# 1:  :disaggregation_value => Option(:name => 'urban'), :summaries => [summary1, summary2, ...]
# 2:  :disaggregation_value => Option(:name => 'rural'), :summaries => [summary1, summary2, ...]
