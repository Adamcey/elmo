# when run, this report generates a fairly complex data structure, as follows:
# StandardFormReport = {
#   :subreports => [
#     {
#       :groups => [
#         {
#           :clusters => [
#             {:summaries => [summary, summary, ...]},
#             {:summaries => [summary, summary, ...]}
#           ]
#         },
#         {
#           :clusters => [
#             {:summaries => [summary, summary, ...]},
#             {:summaries => [summary, summary, ...]}
#           ]
#         }
#       ]
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# Subreports are generated from intermediate constructs called SummaryCollections, which are constructed as follows:
# SummaryCollection = {
#   :subsets => [
#     {
#       :disagg_value => xxx,
#       :summaries => [summary, summary, ...]
#     },
#     {
#       :disagg_value => xxx,
#       :summaries => [summary, summary, ...]
#     }
#   ]
# }
